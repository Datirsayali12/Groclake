# 🛒 Groclake Colabs

Welcome to the **Groclake Colabs Repository**, a collection of interactive notebooks demonstrating the features and components of the Groclake framework — a modular, extensible solution for building intelligent agents, managing data workflows, and integrating with services like MySQL, Elasticsearch, and more.

## 📁 Colabs Overview

### 1. 🔹 **GrocAgent - Simple Chat Agent**

**What is GrocAgent?**

`GrocAgent` is a powerful and extensible Python base class tailored for creating agents in a Flask-based application. It simplifies:
- Intent handling
- Payload management
- Integration with external services

By subclassing `GrocAgent`, developers can define custom agent behaviors for:
- Chatbots  
- Recommendation engines  
- Data processors  

**Notebook Use Case:**  
Builds a simple chat agent using GrocAgent to demonstrate handling dynamic user inputs with intent-based responses.

### 2. 🔹 **DatalakeConnection - Data Pipeline Framework**

**What is Datalake?**

The `DatalakeConnection` class extends the core `Datalake` framework to manage:
- Database connections (MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis)
- Data pipelines for ingestion, transformation, and execution
- Secure configuration using environment variables

**Key Features:**
- 🔄 Inherit and extend Datalake methods
- 🔌 Configure multiple data sources
- 🔧 Create modular pipelines
- 🧵 Execute connections concurrently using threading
- 🗂️ Store and reuse connections dynamically

**Notebook Walkthrough:**
- Shows how to inherit from `Datalake`
- Step-by-step connection setup
- Pipeline creation and execution example

---

### 3. 🔹 **Master File - Central Function Library**

The **Master notebook** acts as a centralized utility hub by importing and utilizing all the core components of the `groclake` library:
- `modellake`
- `resumelake`
- `datalake`
- Other related utilities

**Notebook Purpose:**
- Demonstrates payload management
- Showcases how different modules work together
- Useful for testing and debugging Groclake functionalities in one place

### 4. 🔹 **OrderAgent - Order Status Assistant**

**What is OrderAgent?**

`OrderAgent` is a real-time conversational agent built using `GrocAgent`, designed to track customer orders.

**Features:**
- 📦 Live order tracking
- ⏱️ Estimated delivery updates
- 🌐 Multi-language support

**Example:**
- A user starts with “¿Dónde está mi pedido?” and switches to “Can I expedite the delivery?”  
- The agent handles both languages and provides seamless, relevant updates.

**Notebook Use Case:**  
Shows implementation of multilingual support and real-time status updates using the OrderAgent.
